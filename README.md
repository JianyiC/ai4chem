## Week1 Challenges
- **Data Scarcity and Quality:** Limited experimental flow chemistry data may lead to overfitting or unreliable predictions.  
  - **Solution:** Use data augmentation techniques, cross-validation, and robust feature selection to improve model generalization.
- **Model Hyperparameter Tuning:** Identifying optimal model parameters for batch-to-flow predictions can be time-consuming.  
  - **Solution:** Employ automated hyperparameter search (e.g., Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization) with sensible parameter bounds to accelerate tuning.
- **Integration of Domain Knowledge:** Ensuring the machine learning workflow aligns with chemical synthesis constraints.  
  - **Solution:** Collaborate closely with YLab chemists to encode reaction heuristics and validate model outputs against expert insights.
- **Computational Resources:** Running multiple ML experiments may strain local computing capability.  
  - **Solution:** Leverage cloud or high-performance computing resources when available, and use lightweight models or early-stopping criteria.
